# Text similarity metrics - translation

In this repository, you will find the implementation of the experiments considered in the paper: *Evaluation of Untrained Metrics through Correlation with Human Judgment: the Case of Translation* by A. Lanson and A. Tordjman (2023).

The idea of the paper is to compare several untrained metrics used for measuring machine translation performance.
